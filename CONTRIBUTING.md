Contributing to Schedule
========================

As an open source project, Schedule welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

* Code patches
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

Schedule uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/diemuzi/schedule/issues) to keep track of 
bugs, feature requests, and associated patches.
Patches can be submitted as pull requests, but if you don't file a ticket,
it's unlikely that we'll notice your contribution.

Code of Conduct
===============

As a contributor, you can help us keep the Schedule community open and inclusive.

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
